Server.js and views/js/script.js are the two main files for sending and recieving Data.
This web-app is used for pulling file paths or Filenames from mySQL DB and render multiple images on the frontend.
This web-app can send images from backend to frontend or filepath/fileNames from backend to front end.
Images coming from backend is still buggy, need to fix bufferArray class for multiple single images. Filepath/fileNames coming from backend works fine. --Kelly--
